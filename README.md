Super Rock Jumper
Built in Unity 2022.3.8.8f1

Based on the Unity tutorial, with some added things:
-Score system
-Start and game over screen
-Sick flips
-Extra particle effects on jumps

Known issues: the animations work in the editor, but in the built version only the running animation works

How to play: Press Space to jump over rocks and collect points. Hitting a rock ends the game.
